			If you are accepting these Terms of Service and using the Services on behalf of a company, organization, government, or other legal entity, you represent and warrant to Blush that you have full power and authority to do so.
		</p>
		<p style="text-align: justify;">
			The Services are protected by copyright laws and international copyright treaties, as well as other intellectual property laws and treaties. Unauthorized reproduction or distribution of the Services, or any portion of them, may result in severe civil and criminal penalties, and will be prosecuted to the maximum extent possible under the law. The Services are licensed, not sold.
		</p>

		<h5><b>The Blush Services</b></h5>

		<p style="text-align: justify;">
			Blush is a technology platform that connects make-up artists ("MUA") providing hair and make-up services (“Styling Services”) with clients seeking such service ("Clients" or "you"). The MUAs and Clients are both users of the Services provided by Blush and are hereinafter referred to collectively as "Users."
		</p>
		<p style="text-align: justify;">
			Blush solely provides a platform for MUA and Clients to connect and serves only as a medium to facilitate the provision of Styling Services. Blush does not provide or contract for Styling Services, and MUA and Clients contract independently for the provision of Styling Services. Each Client is solely responsible for selecting the MUA, the Styling Services to be provided and the location at which Styling Services will be performed, whether on the premises of a MUA or at a site designated by the Client. Any decision by a Client to receive Styling Services or by a MUA to provide Styling Services is a decision made in such person's sole discretion and at their own risk. All Users understand and acknowledge that (i) the Company does not conduct background checks on Clients and (ii) any provision of Services in a private location inherently increases the risks involved for both Clients and MUAs.
		</p>
		<p style="text-align: justify;">
			Blush does not have control over the quality, suitability, reliability, timing, durability, legality, failure to provide, or any other aspect whatsoever of any Styling Services provided by MUA nor of the integrity, responsibility or any of the actions or omissions whatsoever of any MUA or Clients.
		</p>
		<p style="text-align: justify;">
			Blush makes no representations or warranties whatsoever with respect to Styling Services offered or provided by MUA or requested by Clients through use of the Services, whether in public, private, or offline interactions, or about the accreditation, registration or licensing of any MUA.
		</p>
		<p style="text-align: justify;">
			You understand that Blush does not routinely screen its Users, inquire into the background of its Users or attempt to verify information provided by any User. Blush does not verify or confirm that any User is who they claim to be or is accurately representing themselves and does not verify or confirm any representations with respect to Styling Services on the Services.
		</p>
		<p style="text-align: justify;">
			Blush does not assume any responsibility for the accuracy or reliability of this information or any information provided through the Services. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Blush may, but is not obligated to, check the background and experience of MUA via third-party background check services and first party interviews, including but not limited to a verification of identity and a comprehensive criminal background check, and may terminate a MUA based on any information discovered during such background checks and first party interviews. Whether or not Blush conducts a background check or first party interview on a MUA, each Client must decide whether a MUA is suited to such Client's needs and should exercise caution and common sense to protect their personal safety and property, just as they would when interacting with anyone you don't know. NEITHER COMPANY NOR ITS AFFILIATES OR LICENSORS IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CONDUCT, WHETHER ONLINE OR OFFLINE, OF ANY USER OF THE SERVICES AND YOU HEREBY RELEASE THE COMPANY AND ITS AFFILIATES OR LICENSORS FROM ANY LIABILITY RELATED THERETO.  COMPANY AND ITS AFFILIATES AND LICENSORS WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, INJURY OR DAMAGE ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES.

			In connection with certain services, including Styling Services, for which reservations are made available on the Services, some MUAs may require you to enter credit card or other payment information, and such MUAs may charge fees for reservations, including cancelled and missed appointments. Blush is not responsible for any fees or charges or any errors in the processing of payments, including any errors that result from negligence, improper transmission of payment information, your mistaken submission of payment information, or your submission of erroneous payment information.
		</p>

		<p style="text-align: justify;">
			Although the Services are intended to provide a MUA's availability in real-time, it is possible that a scheduling conflict may occur that requires the MUA to reschedule your reservation. Creation of a reservation using the Services is not a guarantee that the MUA will honor the reservation as scheduled.
		</p>

		<p style="text-align: justify;">
			Blush cannot guarantee availability of the Services to any User.

		<p style="text-align: justify;">
			Blush does not independently confirm that MUAs are licensed to perform the Styling Services offered by them on the Service.
